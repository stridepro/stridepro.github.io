<section class="cheese">
<header>Blue Cashel Irish</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="cashel" />
<p>Jane and Louis Grubb have been making the Cashel Blue cheese on their farms since 1984. It is Ireland’s original, farmhouse blue cheese as till then there was no blue cheese made on Irish farms. Nearly 50% of the pasteurised milk used in the cheese comes from Grubb’s selected Holstein-Friesians cows while the remaining comes from local herds. The rennet used in making in this cheese makes it suitable for vegetarians.
<p>Depending on the age, Cashel Blue texture varies from chalky to soft yellow paste and a characteristic bluish green mould. Young cheeses taste & smell chalky, lactic and mildly blue while the older ones are rich & buttery with a well-formed blue colour. Over 18 weeks of maturing, the cheese takes on a robust flavour and is granular in texture. It is one of the finest blue cheeses that relies on it's balance in taste, texture and aroma.

<section class="cheese">
<header>Shropshire Blue</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="shropshire" />
<p>Shropshire Blue is a cow's milk cheese made in the United Kingdom. The cheese was first made in the 1970s at the Castle Stuart dairy in Inverness, Scotland by Andy Williamson, a cheesemaker who had trained in the making of Stilton cheese in Nottinghamshire. The cheese was first known as 'Inverness-shire Blue' or 'Blue Stuart', but was eventually marketed as 'Shropshire Blue', a name chosen to help increase its popularity, despite it having no link to the county of Shropshire.
<p>After the Castle Stuart dairy was closed down in 1980, the cheese was revived by Elliot Hulme and Harry Hanlin of Cheshire, but once again the manufacture soon ceased. The cheese is now made by the Long Clawson, Leicestershire and the Cropwell Bishop and Colston Bassett dairies in Nottinghamshire. Since 2010, Shropshire Blue has been made by the Shropshire Cheese Company, a Shropshire Dairy Farm on the Welsh Border.

<header>Sriracha Cheddar</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="shropshire" />
<p>Vintage English cheddar with spicy Sriracha.</p>
</section>


<section class="cheese">
<header>Reny Picot Smoked Gouda</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="shropshire" />
<p>Real smoked gouda, not smoke flavored, from Benton Harbor, Michigan. This cow milk's gouda is not overly smoked but is smooth and delicious.</p>
</section>

<section class="cheese">
<header>Canadian Cheddar</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="shropshire" />
<p>Aged 3 years minimum, this has the smooth bite of age. Aged cheese has a more complex flavor than a younger cheese. And it is drier. This Canadian cheddar is long on flavor and deliciously sharp.</p>
</section>


<section class="cheese">
<header>Gruyere de Comte</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="shropshire" />
<p>Smooth and sweet, this raw cow's milk cheese is mde in France from a centuries old recipe. The wheels ave been made since the reign of Charlemagne. As it ages, Comte gets `Swissier'.</p>
</section>

<section class="cheese">
<header>Antique Gruyere</header>
<p>Just as Eskimos distinguish between a dozen different sorts of snow, the Swiss appreciate a wide range of Gruyères: young Gruyère, aged Gruyère, mountain Gruyère, summer Gruyère, winter Gruyère, Gruyère from small village cheesemakers, Gruyère from large commercial dairies. Depending upon season, source and age, the flavor and texture of the cheeses are significantly altered.
<p>Seventy-pound wheels are aged for over a year (at least six months longer than standard issue Gruyère), hence the term "antique." The extra aging gives this Alpine cheese an exceptionally full flavor.
<p>Imagine the flavor of the Gruyère you know now but ten times more delicious and infinitely more interesting. Smooth, with the spiciness of a great Rhine wine. It's got an incredible nose and a dry, yet creamy on the tongue texture.

<section class="cheese">
<header>Cabot Zingerman's Cheddar</header>
<p>Aged just under a year, it's a great snacking cheddar. We select batches that feature creamy texture and hearty, savory flavors that pair well with salami, crackers, crusty bread, beer, wine, etc. 
<p>It also makes delicious grilled cheese sandwiches and is the perfect accompaniment to your next cheeseburger. Grab a block or two and spread the cheese love.

<section class="cheese">
<header>Brebis d'Ossau</header>
<p>From the pink and purple hydrangea-dotted mountainsides of the Pyrenees comes some of the best sheep’s milk cheeses France's Basque region has to offer.
<p>These wheels are literally hand made. The cheese makers reach an arm into their kettle of warm curd and — ever so slowly — gently break it into the small pieces from which the final cheese will be formed. This ancient technique protects the fragile flavor of the finished cheese and enhances the quality of the full-flavored mountain milk. By using these old methods, a maker can get only two or three ten-pound wheels a day.
<p>But the few cheeses made each day are marvelous. After at least six months of mellow maturing the cheese evolves into lovely, smooth, subtly fruity wheels with a nice little bit of a nose and a long, lingering sensual finish. I could eat this cheese every day for lunch.

<section class="cheese">
<header>Parmigiano Reggiano</header>
<p>Not all the wheels that bear the world famous Parmigiano-Reggiano name are created equal. There are big differences from one to the next.
<p>This cheese is made by a dairy nearly 2,000 feet up in the hills outside of Modena, Italy. The high altitude makes for plenty of diversity in the grasses, herbs and flowers growing in the cows’ pastures. This means that the milk—and subsequently, your cheese—is full of each pasture's complex flavors. The wheels are aged for at least two years (33% longer than the Consorzio minimum).
<p>Most important, the finished cheese has a really rich, wonderfully complex flavor with a lovely, long finish. And it has none of the bitterness or mouth burn that often mars the final flavor of others. Outstanding. Our most popular cheese by a wide margin.

<header>Black Betty</header>
<input type="checkbox" id="betty" />
<p>L'Amuse's Brabander Goat Gouda has become a favorite of the Essex Street Cheese collection, with its beautiful white paste and lovely flavors of caramel and butter. Every so often, affineur Betty Koster selects a handful of these wheels, normally aged 6-9 months, and holds onto them for an additional 6 months. The extra time in the caves results in a firmer paste and a more intense flavor. To distinguish the cheese from the younger Brabander, Koster coats it in black wax -- hence, the name Black Betty.
<p>This gouda is made from the pasteurized milk of Saanen goats. The wheels are ripened in caves with slightly higher ambient temperatures to ensure proper drying and, in turn, fuller flavors that smack of pineapple and brown butter.
